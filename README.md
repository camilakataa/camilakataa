B.S. of civil engineer at UNIFEI (Universidade Federal de Itajub√°). with almost four years of experience in the field. I have always enjoyed working with spreadsheet optimization, software, and learning new technologies, which sparked my interest in gaining knowledge in the field of software development and led me to pursue a career transition.<br>

I also acquired cloud computing knowledge in AWS and hold the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.<br>
